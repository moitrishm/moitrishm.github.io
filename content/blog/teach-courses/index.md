## Description

Bacterial populations can be made up of several sub-populations known as phenotypes. 
The phenotypes are genetically identical, but a given phenotype may possess advantageous traits -- such as resistance to antibiotics -- 
that can enable the bacterial population to survive in adverse environments [1]. 
In the presence of an antibiotic, an individual cell in a bacterial population could switch to a resistant phenotype
to maximize the entire population's chances of survival. We modeled a bacterial population with inter-phenotypic switching
as a network, with every node representing a phenotype and every (directed) edge represented the ability of 
one phenotype to switch to another phenotype. 
The edge weights encode the rate of switching from one phenotype to another [2].
We observed that as more switching pathways were restricted (which was modeled as removal of edges from the network), the edge weights on the remaining edges
would have to be increased, in order to maintain the asymptotic population growth rate.
